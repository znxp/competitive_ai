## Rapid7 InsightVM – Vulnerability Management 

**Description:** InsightVM is Rapid7’s cloud-based Vulnerability Risk Management solution (the evolution of the earlier on-premises Nexpose scanner). It continuously discovers and assesses assets for vulnerabilities across on-premises and cloud environments ([Rapid7 InsightVM: Key Features, Pros/Cons & Quick Tutorial - Coralogix](https://coralogix.com/guides/rapid7-insightvm/#:~:text=Rapid7%20InsightVM%20is%20a%20vulnerability,can%20be%20exploited%20by%20attackers)). InsightVM provides features like a **Lightweight Endpoint Agent** for real-time visibility (useful for remote or intermittently connected assets) ([Rapid7 InsightVM: Key Features, Pros/Cons & Quick Tutorial - Coralogix](https://coralogix.com/guides/rapid7-insightvm/#:~:text=Lightweight%20Endpoint%20Agent)), **Live Dashboards** for up-to-date risk metrics ([Rapid7 InsightVM: Key Features, Pros/Cons & Quick Tutorial - Coralogix](https://coralogix.com/guides/rapid7-insightvm/#:~:text=Live%20Dashboards)), and **Remediation Projects** to assign and track fixes. It integrates threat intelligence (e.g. via Rapid7’s AttackerKB and Metasploit databases) to help prioritize risks ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=Dashboards)). InsightVM’s analytics and reporting help security teams prioritize critical issues and measure improvements in security posture ([Rapid7 InsightVM: Key Features, Pros/Cons & Quick Tutorial - Coralogix](https://coralogix.com/guides/rapid7-insightvm/#:~:text=Rapid7%20InsightVM%20is%20a%20vulnerability,can%20be%20exploited%20by%20attackers)) ([Rapid7 InsightVM: Key Features, Pros/Cons & Quick Tutorial - Coralogix](https://coralogix.com/guides/rapid7-insightvm/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20its%20core,to%20improve%20their%20security%20posture)). The product also integrates with other IT and DevOps tools (ticketing systems like Jira, configuration management, etc.) to streamline remediation workflows. Rapid7’s 2009 acquisition of **Metasploit** contributes to InsightVM via automated exploit exposure checks (e.g. Metasploit integration to validate vulnerabilities) ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=Dashboards)). InsightVM can be deployed entirely as a cloud service with distributed scan engines, making it scalable for large networks.

**Pricing:** Rapid7 lists InsightVM starting at **$1.93 per asset per month** (when licensed for 500 assets) ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=INSIGHT%20VM)). This equates to about $23 per asset annually, though actual pricing will scale based on asset volume and any additional modules. (By comparison, Qualys VMDR is typically quoted around **$199 per asset per year** for full vulnerability and compliance management, based on third-party estimates ([Qualys Pricing 2025: Ultimate Guide for Security Products](https://underdefense.com/industry-pricings/qualys-pricing-2025-ultimate-guide-for-security-products/#:~:text=Qualys%20Pricing%202025%3A%20Ultimate%20Guide,of%20assets%20and%20selected)), indicating Rapid7’s entry price can be more cost-effective for similar asset counts.) All Insight platform subscriptions, including InsightVM, come with unlimited user accounts and include support and platform access features ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=Everything%20that%20comes%20with%20your,plan)).

**User Feedback:** Customers appreciate that InsightVM offers rich dashboards, reporting, and integrated threat intel to prioritize risks. For example, one user notes the product “checks all the boxes” from identification to remediation and lauds its integrations of Metasploit, AttackerKB, and other research data for context ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=Dashboards)) ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=What%20problems%20is%20InsightVM%20,how%20is%20that%20benefiting%20you)). The **Risk scoring** (Rapid7’s Real Risk or Active Risk score) and remediation project capabilities are highlighted as particularly useful ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=Tons%20of%20threat%20intelligence%20and,some%20of%20the%20best%20integrations)). Another long-term user describes InsightVM as “the best product for vulnerability management” in their experience, praising that Rapid7 “keep[s] track of all zero-days” and updates the scanner’s CVE database within 24 hours ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=I%20have%20been%20using%20this,com)). The same reviewer also values the all-in-one dashboard for visibility ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=I%20have%20been%20using%20this,com)). On the negative side, some users mention the **console can be buggy** and that certain integrations (like the Jira integration for ticketing) “break all the time” ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,Nexpose)). Scanning performance for newly emerging issues is another critique – e.g. one review noted it took InsightVM 3 days to detect a critical new vulnerability in their environment, which was seen as too slow ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=The%20security%20console%20is%20a,lot%20buggy)). There is also a learning curve in initial setup; a user reported “too much administrative effort to set up stuff” in the environment ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=Native%20Jira%20integration%20is%20not,Breaks%20all%20the%20time)). Overall, however, multiple users state that InsightVM is **more user-friendly** and “far better than the other tools I’ve used in the past (Tenable, Qualys, MS Defender)” ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=What%20problems%20is%20InsightVM%20,how%20is%20that%20benefiting%20you)), indicating high satisfaction with Rapid7’s approach to vulnerability management.

## Rapid7 InsightIDR – Detection and Response (SIEM & XDR)

**Description:** InsightIDR is Rapid7’s SaaS-based **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** and XDR solution for threat detection and incident response ([InsightIDR Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightidr/reviews#:~:text=What%20is%20InsightIDR%3F)). It ingests data from diverse sources (endpoint agents, network traffic, authentication logs, cloud services, etc.) and applies user behavior analytics, attacker behavior analytics, and built-in detection rules to identify suspicious activities. InsightIDR combines traditional SIEM log management with endpoint detection (via the same Insight Agent) and deception technology (honeypots/honey credentials) to catch intrusions early. It provides an intuitive interface for investigators – including visual incident timelines and automated response actions. Rapid7 has integrated technology from the acquisitions of **Logentries (2015)** for log analytics and **NetFort (2019)** for network traffic analysis into InsightIDR, enhancing its log search and network visibility capabilities ([Rapid7 Announces Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results](https://investors.rapid7.com/news/news-details/2019/Rapid7-Announces-Second-Quarter-2019-Financial-Results-08-01-2019/default.aspx#:~:text=Results%20investors,analytics%20cloud%2C%20virtual%20and)) ([Rapid7 Announces Availability of Network Traffic Analysis Capabilities](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/rapid7-announces-availability-of-network-traffic-analysis-capabilities-in-insightidr/#:~:text=Rapid7%20Announces%20Availability%20of%20Network,based%20Netfort%20in%202019)). InsightIDR comes with many pre-built correlation rules and alerts, which reduces the tuning effort for security teams. It also tightly integrates with Rapid7’s SOAR (InsightConnect) to provide one-click automated containment (for example, disabling a compromised user account when an alert triggers). Overall, InsightIDR is positioned as a SIEM that’s faster to deploy and easier to manage than traditional on-premises SIEMs, targeting lean security teams that need effective detection without heavy overhead.

**Pricing:** Rapid7’s pricing page lists InsightIDR starting at **$5.89 per asset per month** ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=INSIGHT%20IDR)). Unlike some SIEMs that price by volume of data ingested, Rapid7 uses an asset-count model (where an “asset” can be an endpoint or server monitored). This starting price includes all core SIEM features (logging, UBA, detection rules, etc.) and even deception technology. A small organization with 250 assets, for example, could expect list pricing around $1,472 per month (250 × $5.89), but pricing may vary based on exact asset definition and volume discounts. Users have noted that InsightIDR can be **expensive for smaller organizations** – one review pointed out that while the value is outstanding, “smaller organisations with tighter budgets could find its pricing to be on the expensive side” ([InsightIDR Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightidr/reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,InsightIDR)). In comparison, Qualys does not offer a SIEM; organizations often pair Qualys with a separate SIEM like Splunk or IBM QRadar, which have their own distinct cost models.

**User Feedback:** InsightIDR is frequently praised for its **ease of use and deployment speed**. Security teams report that the “lightweight cloud deployment and intuitive UI” allow them to get value from Day 1 ([InsightIDR Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightidr/reviews#:~:text=Rapid7%20InsightIDR%20is%20a%20SaaS,response%20program%20without%20adding%20headcount)). One user highlighted that InsightIDR provides **detailed visibility into any event** and is flexible enough to ingest many third-party data sources, giving a “single view into your entire environment without having to go to multiple dashboards” ([InsightIDR Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightidr/reviews#:~:text=Insight%20IDR%20provides%20a%20detailed,com)). The product’s out-of-the-box detections and contextual alerting are appreciated – alerts come with detailed reasoning and even remediation guidance, which “makes it easy to resolve issues” and gives peace of mind that monitoring is 24/7 ([InsightIDR Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightidr/reviews#:~:text=What%20problems%20is%20InsightIDR%20solving,how%20is%20that%20benefiting%20you)). Customers also value the **“visibility and threat detection”** capabilities as “vital” to their security program ([InsightIDR Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightidr/reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20like%20best,about%20InsightIDR)). On the downside, some reviews mention that **certain integrations can be clunky**, particularly for collecting logs from Windows systems (which may require deploying additional “collector” servers) ([InsightIDR Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightidr/reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,InsightIDR)). Those additional log collectors can introduce cost or maintenance overhead if running in cloud environments ([InsightIDR Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightidr/reviews#:~:text=There%20can%20be%20a%20lot,com)). Another common theme is that InsightIDR’s **pricing** can become a challenge for smaller companies ([InsightIDR Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightidr/reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,InsightIDR)). In exchange for its robust capabilities, it may be **resource-intensive** in terms of both computing (when processing lots of data) and budget ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=%2A%20Known%20for%20its%20user,interface)). Overall, however, InsightIDR enjoys positive sentiment for bringing enterprise-grade detection within reach of lean teams – Rapid7 was recognized as a **Challenger** in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for SIEM, reflecting strong execution and completeness of vision in this space ([Rapid7 Recognized in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for SIEM](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/05/13/rapid7-recognized-in-the-2024-gartner-r-magic-quadrant-for-siem/#:~:text=Rapid7%20Recognized%20in%20the%202024,Gartner%20Magic%20Quadrant%20for%20SIEM)).

## Rapid7 InsightAppSec – Web Application Security Testing

**Description:** InsightAppSec is Rapid7’s dynamic application security testing (DAST) product, used to scan web applications and APIs for vulnerabilities. It originated from Rapid7’s acquisition of **NTObjectives (NTO) in 2015**, whose AppSpider scanning engine was incorporated and rebranded as InsightAppSec ([Rapid7 Extends IT Security Data and Analytics Platform with Acquisition](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/rapid7-acquisition-nt-objectives/#:~:text=Rapid7%2C%20a%20leading%20provider%20of,AppSpider%2C%20available%20immediately%20to%20customers)). InsightAppSec can perform automated security tests (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.) against modern web applications, including single-page apps and mobile backends. It features authentication handling, attack replay, and integration options for SDLC (such as CI/CD pipeline integration to test apps pre-production). The solution is cloud-hosted by Rapid7, with the option to deploy scan engines on-premises for internal apps. Rapid7 also offers a **RASP** (runtime application self-protection) add-on called **tCell** (acquired in 2018), which provides in-app protection and monitoring; tCell can complement InsightAppSec by defending applications in real time ([Top 15 DevSecOps Tools that Accelerate Development - Spectral](https://spectralops.io/blog/top-15-devsecops-tools-that-accelerate-development/#:~:text=Spectral%20spectralops,%E2%80%9D%20tCell)). Together, these allow Rapid7 to cover both pre-production testing and runtime protection. InsightAppSec’s interface emphasizes ease of use – users can start a scan with minimal setup and then get detailed findings with remediation guidance. It also provides **attack replay** functionality so developers can replicate how a vulnerability was discovered. The product supports integration with issue trackers (e.g. pushing findings to JIRA or ServiceNow) to facilitate remediation.

**Pricing:** Rapid7 prices InsightAppSec by the number of applications. The starting price is about **$175 per app per month** ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=Web%20Application%20Security)). This typically includes an unlimited number of scans for that application. (For instance, scanning 10 web apps would start around $1,750/month at list price.) This pricing model is competitive with other DAST solutions – e.g. Qualys Web Application Scanning (WAS) is also licensed per web app, often in the range of a few hundred dollars per app per month depending on volume. Rapid7 also offers a **managed application security service** (Managed AppSec) for organizations that want Rapid7’s experts to handle the scanning and results analysis ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=,Continuous%20Red%20Teaming%20VECTOR%20COMMAND)).

**User Feedback:** Users generally find InsightAppSec (AppSpider) to be **user-friendly and straightforward**. One reviewer from a small business said the tool “is so user friendly…whatever you want to do is self-explanatory. We can initiate scans or download reports” easily ([InsightAppSec (AppSpider) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightappsec-appspider/reviews/insightappsec-appspider-review-7031643#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20like%20best,AppSpider)). Many appreciate its effectiveness in finding common web vulnerabilities with relatively **few false positives** compared to other scanners ([InsightAppSec (AppSpider) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightappsec-appspider/reviews/insightappsec-appspider-review-7031643#:~:text=It%20scans%20apps%20and%20gives,com)). The scan results are detailed and include remediation suggestions that users find helpful ([InsightAppSec (AppSpider) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightappsec-appspider/reviews/insightappsec-appspider-review-7031643#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20like%20best,AppSpider)). In particular, InsightAppSec excels at standard **OWASP Top 10** issues – one user noted that after deploying the tool, their previously OWASP Top 10-prone apps are now much more secure, reducing overall risk ([InsightAppSec (AppSpider) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightappsec-appspider/reviews/insightappsec-appspider-review-7031643#:~:text=What%20problems%20is%20InsightAppSec%20,how%20is%20that%20benefiting%20you)). On the negative side, some users have observed that InsightAppSec **sometimes fails to flag certain high-severity issues**. One review mentioned “it doesn’t detect Critical or High vulnerabilities so often” ([InsightAppSec (AppSpider) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightappsec-appspider/reviews/insightappsec-appspider-review-7031643#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,AppSpider)), suggesting that in some cases serious bugs were missed or perhaps not categorized as expected. Additionally, initial deployment for certain environments can be tricky – a reviewer noted it’s “not easy to deploy when it comes to scanning apps that are hosted in a cloud environment,” and they faced issues setting up scans for cloud-hosted apps ([InsightAppSec (AppSpider) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightappsec-appspider/reviews/insightappsec-appspider-review-7031643#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,AppSpider)). Another limitation mentioned is that InsightAppSec focuses on web app (layer 7) vulnerabilities and **does not perform network-layer scans** (which is by design, but a user cited as a “dislike” that it’s unable to do network-layer testing) ([InsightAppSec (AppSpider) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightappsec-appspider/reviews/insightappsec-appspider-review-7031643#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,AppSpider)). Despite these drawbacks, the general sentiment is that InsightAppSec is a **“very good security testing tool for DAST”** with easy integration into development workflows, and its shortcomings are around edge cases or the need to supplement it with other tools for full coverage ([InsightAppSec (AppSpider) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightappsec-appspider/reviews/insightappsec-appspider-review-7031643#:~:text=Rapid%207%20tool%20is%20so,com)) ([InsightAppSec (AppSpider) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightappsec-appspider/reviews/insightappsec-appspider-review-7031643#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20like%20best,AppSpider)).

## Rapid7 InsightCloudSec – Cloud Security Posture Management

**Description:** InsightCloudSec is Rapid7’s Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and cloud workload protection platform. It came from the April 2020 acquisition of **DivvyCloud**, which Rapid7 rebranded as InsightCloudSec ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=)). InsightCloudSec provides continuous visibility into misconfigurations, security risks, and compliance violations across multi-cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, and others). It automatically discovers cloud resources (instances, containers, serverless functions, storage buckets, etc.) and assesses them against security best practices and compliance frameworks (such as CIS Benchmarks, SOC 2, PCI DSS, etc.) ([Rapid7 InsightCloudSec Reviews, Ratings & Features 2025 - Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/cloud-security-posture-management-tools/vendor/rapid7/product/insightcloudsec#:~:text=Rapid7%20InsightCloudSec%20Reviews%2C%20Ratings%20%26,Benchmarks%2C%20Cost%20containment%20packs%2C)). The product includes a library of policy checks and can automate remediation or send alerts when issues are found. Rapid7 has enhanced InsightCloudSec with additional capabilities via acquisitions like **Alcide (2021)** for Kubernetes security ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=Rapid7%20Acquires%20Leading%20Kubernetes%20Security,Provider%2C%20Alcide)), which added container/K8s workload protection and governance features to the platform. As a result, InsightCloudSec today can check not only cloud infrastructure configuration but also aspects of container cluster security and even integrate with CI/CD to enforce Infrastructure-as-Code security (e.g., checking Terraform or CloudFormation templates) ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=)). The platform emphasizes **“continuous security and compliance”** – changes in the cloud environment are detected in real-time and evaluated. For example, if someone opens a security group or an S3 bucket to the public internet, InsightCloudSec will flag it almost immediately. It also supports automation (“bots”) to take action, like auto-remediating unsafe settings or garbage collecting unused resources. This allows organizations to maintain governance at cloud speed.

**Pricing:** Rapid7’s published starting price for InsightCloudSec is **$5,775 per month for up to 500 cloud instances** ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=Cloud%20Security)). This pricing covers a block of resources; larger environments would be priced in higher tiers or increments (for example, the cost per instance typically decreases as you cover thousands of instances). The definition of “instance” in pricing includes virtual machines or cloud workloads under management. Qualys, by contrast, offers cloud security via its **Qualys CloudView** and related apps, which are also licensed per asset or per cloud account – Qualys pricing is quote-based, but in practice tends to be modular (e.g., one price for cloud inventory, another for container security). In general, InsightCloudSec’s pricing aims to be a comprehensive subscription for all-in-one cloud risk management, whereas organizations could assemble equivalent capabilities with Qualys by combining its Asset Management, CSPM, and Container Security modules.

**User Feedback:** Users value InsightCloudSec (DivvyCloud) for strong **compliance and visibility** in cloud environments. In a discussion, one user mentioned DivvyCloud was “great for compliance and adherence” and provided *“wonderful, useful insight into the cloud environments”* ([Has anyone tested Rapid7's cloud security offerings? : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/vgaom0/has_anyone_tested_rapid7s_cloud_security_offerings/#:~:text=DivvyCloud%20was%20great%20for%20for,container%20security%2C%20or%20anything%20related)). In particular, the breadth of pre-built **compliance packs** (for standards like SOC 2, PCI, CIS benchmarks) is seen as a major plus ([Rapid7 InsightCloudSec Reviews, Ratings & Features 2025 - Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/cloud-security-posture-management-tools/vendor/rapid7/product/insightcloudsec#:~:text=Rapid7%20InsightCloudSec%20Reviews%2C%20Ratings%20%26,Benchmarks%2C%20Cost%20containment%20packs%2C)). Gartner Peer Insights notes that InsightCloudSec is “amazing in the compliance security area” with numerous frameworks supported out-of-the-box ([Rapid7 InsightCloudSec Reviews, Ratings & Features 2025 - Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/cloud-security-posture-management-tools/vendor/rapid7/product/insightcloudsec#:~:text=Rapid7%20InsightCloudSec%20Reviews%2C%20Ratings%20%26,Benchmarks%2C%20Cost%20containment%20packs%2C)). This helps reduce the overhead of maintaining cloud compliance manually. On the flip side, some feedback indicates the product can be **challenging to work with** for advanced use cases – one G2 review noted it’s a good platform for finding misconfigurations and vulnerabilities *“but it’s a bit challenging to work with due to the lack…”* (context suggests lack of user-friendly UX or certain integrations) ([Rapid7 Security Services Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features](https://www.g2.com/products/rapid7-security-services/reviews#:~:text=Features%20www,due%20to%20the%20lack)). Indeed, as a CSPM tool dealing with complex cloud environments, some learning curve is expected; users have hinted that improvements in **user-friendliness and documentation** would help. Additionally, while compliance and cloud configuration issues are well-handled, InsightCloudSec is **not a full cloud workload protection platform (CWPP)** – for example, it’s “not so great as anything beyond [compliance] (aka cloud workload security, container security or anything related)” according to one practitioner’s comment ([Has anyone tested Rapid7's cloud security offerings? : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/vgaom0/has_anyone_tested_rapid7s_cloud_security_offerings/#:~:text=DivvyCloud%20was%20great%20for%20for,container%20security%2C%20or%20anything%20related)). Rapid7 has been addressing this by integrating container/K8s security (from Alcide) and offering agent-based workload scanning via InsightVM, but competitors (like Wiz or Orca in the cloud security market) might provide more unified CNAPP capabilities. In summary, InsightCloudSec is regarded as a powerful tool to gain multi-cloud visibility and enforce governance, with users especially appreciating how it helps them **“understand and prioritize” cloud risks ([AWS Marketplace: Rapid7 - Amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=1121698c-7b7b-4a71-86d3-cfc65ab72368#:~:text=InsightCloudSec%20helps%20teams%20secure%20even,understand%20and%20prioritize%20them))**, even if there is room to streamline the user experience for complex cloud setups.

## Rapid7 InsightConnect – Security Orchestration, Automation and Response

**Description:** InsightConnect is Rapid7’s **SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation and Response)** product. It originated from Rapid7’s 2017 acquisition of **Komand**, a security automation startup ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1200%20Rapid7%20Acquires,Orchestration%20and%20Automation%20Company%2C%20Komand)). InsightConnect allows security teams to build automated workflows (called “Playbooks”) that integrate across different tools and services – from firewalls, SIEMs, ticketing systems, cloud platforms, to messaging apps. It comes with a library of over 300 pre-built integrations or “plugins” for popular products and APIs, enabling relatively quick setup of automation without coding. Common use cases include automated phishing email analysis, user deprovisioning, enrichment of alerts with threat intel, or even responding to incidents (like blocking an IP on a firewall automatically when confirmed malicious by InsightIDR). InsightConnect features a visual workflow builder, so analysts can drag-and-drop logic (conditions, loops, etc.) and actions. Python scripting is supported for customization, but many tasks can be done via pre-built steps. The goal of InsightConnect is to reduce manual, repetitive tasks and **“accelerate your teams and tools”** by connecting them ([Rapid7 Products | Read 229 Reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/sellers/rapid7#:~:text=of%20their%20products%20,security%20orchestration%20and%20automation%20capabilities)). Rapid7 has also integrated InsightConnect throughout its platform – for example, within InsightIDR you can trigger an InsightConnect workflow in one click on an alert, and within InsightVM you can use automation to create tickets or do network quarantines. This tight coupling of SOAR with the rest of the Insight products is a differentiator for Rapid7’s platform.

**Pricing:** Rapid7 does not list InsightConnect as a standalone priced product on the public pricing page (it is often included or offered at a low cost to Insight platform customers to drive adoption). In practice, InsightConnect is typically licensed either by the number of workflows or sometimes as an add-on per environment. Many customers effectively get InsightConnect bundled when they have other major products. By contrast, standalone SOAR products in the market (Splunk Phantom, Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR, etc.) might be licensed by users or by action runs. Rapid7’s strategy has been to make automation accessible – in some cases they’ve included InsightConnect for free in certain license tiers to encourage customers to automate. For an exact quote, organizations need to engage Rapid7, but it’s safe to say the **cost of InsightConnect is relatively small compared to the core scanning or SIEM products** – one reason Rapid7 touts it as a value-add (e.g., their “Insight” platform subscriptions all include the ability to use InsightConnect with **“Rapid7 and community-built extensions”** available ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=,Central%20account%20dashboard))).

**User Feedback:** Users appreciate the broad integration capabilities of InsightConnect. A common theme is the **“numerous out-of-the-box connectors”** for different services and the flexibility to automate almost anything ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20like%20best,about%20InsightConnect)). One reviewer loves *“how many integrations it has and how more are added over time,”* calling the product extremely feature-rich ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20like%20best,about%20InsightConnect)). The ease of setting up basic automations is praised – *“out of the box functionality”* is high, and setup is *“easy [and] straightforward”* according to another user ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20like%20best,about%20InsightConnect)). For example, teams can quickly integrate with communication tools like Slack or MS Teams to create interactive security bots, which one review highlighted as a great feature (the ability to send and respond to prompts via chat for on-the-go interaction) ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20like%20best,about%20InsightConnect)). On the negative side, **some scripting or coding knowledge is often needed** to unlock InsightConnect’s full potential. A user pointed out that while it has many plugins, *“make sure you or someone on your team knows at least one scripting language well,”* because advanced customization may require scripting ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect/reviews#reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,InsightConnect)). This suggests that for complex workflows, one might have to write Python snippets or deal with APIs directly. Additionally, one review mentioned that the **user-friendliness could be enhanced** – implying the interface, while functional, might be less polished than desired ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect/reviews#reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,InsightConnect)). Another user noted that having a clear vision and strategy for how to use InsightConnect is important; if an organization hasn’t defined their automation use cases, the product *“doesn’t have a clear [value]”* for them ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect/reviews#reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,InsightConnect)). There were also mentions of a **lack of certain integrations** – for example, one user wanted better Google services integration out-of-the-box ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect/reviews#reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,InsightConnect)) – and that reporting on automation metrics isn’t very robust (no built-in fancy reports, mainly just widgets) ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect/reviews#reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,InsightConnect)). Despite these critiques, InsightConnect’s overall reception is positive, particularly for its **time-saving benefits**. Users have reported that it *“provides value from day one”* and that it was *“very smooth to expose the value to the board”* (i.e., easy to demonstrate ROI) ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect/reviews#reviews#:~:text=the%20mundane,com)). The backing of Rapid7’s support is also noted: *“Finally, it’s Rapid7, so you know you’ll get excellent service,”* one user quipped, underscoring that Rapid7’s customer support for the product has been strong ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect/reviews#reviews#:~:text=the%20mundane,com)).

## Rapid7 Threat Command – External Threat Intelligence 

**Description:** Threat Command is Rapid7’s External Threat Intelligence and Digital Risk Protection offering. It is the result of Rapid7’s mid-2021 acquisition of **IntSights**, an Israeli threat intelligence company ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=match%20at%20L746%20Rapid7%20Acquires,Second%20Quarter%202021%20Financial%20Results)). Threat Command is a SaaS platform that monitors the clear, deep, and dark web for threats related to an organization. This includes detecting exposed credentials, mentions of the company or its assets in criminal forums, phishing domains or brand impersonation, data leaks, and other external threats. The service not only gathers intelligence but also provides actionable mitigation options – for example, facilitating takedown of phishing sites or removing leaked code. IntSights (now Threat Command) brought with it a rich set of integrations and an automated approach to curating intelligence: it can aggregate **“tens of thousands of threats”** and automatically prioritize them ([Threat Command by Rapid7 Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/threat-command-by-rapid7/reviews#:~:text=Product%20Description)). Rapid7 has integrated Threat Command with the rest of the Insight platform as well (for instance, intel from Threat Command can enrich alerts in InsightIDR or feed into automation workflows). Threat Command is delivered as a combination of technology and managed service; customers get a portal for live intelligence and alerts, and Rapid7’s analysts are available to assist or provide assessments. Overall, Threat Command extends Rapid7’s coverage to the external attack surface, helping companies to **“neutralize threats outside the wire”** before they impact the organization ([Threat Command by Rapid7 Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/threat-command-by-rapid7/reviews#:~:text=IntSights%20is%20the%20leading%20external,Capital%2C%20Blumberg%20Capital%2C%20and%20others)).

**Pricing:** Threat Command (IntSights) is typically priced by the scope of digital footprint monitored. According to G2, IntSights’ pricing is based on the size of the enterprise’s digital footprint (number of domains, brands, keywords monitored, etc.) ([Threat Command by Rapid7 Pricing - G2](https://www.g2.com/products/threat-command-by-rapid7/pricing#:~:text=Threat%20Command%20by%20Rapid7%20Pricing,customer%27s%20digital%20footprint%20and)). This means larger organizations with more brands and internet-facing assets will pay more. Precise pricing isn’t public; it usually involves an annual subscription that can range widely (from tens of thousands of USD for mid-size companies to much higher for large enterprises with extensive monitoring needs). Rapid7 likely offers Threat Command as an add-on service for InsightIDR customers or as a standalone intel service. Compared to Qualys, this is an area where Qualys doesn’t have a direct competing product – Qualys focuses on internal asset risk, whereas Threat Command is about external threat intel. Organizations might otherwise consider competitors like Recorded Future, Digital Shadows, or CrowdStrike’s intel offerings, which are similarly priced on a subscription model.

**User Feedback:** Threat Command (IntSights) users have noted that the platform is **easy to use** and provides a lot of information in one place. One G2 reviewer said *“everything can be found in one place yet easily identifiable,”* highlighting that adding new assets to monitor is very easy and the tool shows **“deep insights into the vulnerabilities found in the network and how to remediate them.”* ([Threat Command by Rapid7 Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/threat-command-by-rapid7/reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20like%20best,about%20Threat%20Command%20by%20Rapid7)). (It’s worth noting the mention of “vulnerabilities in the network” – possibly the user is referring to digital risks rather than software vulnerabilities, since Threat Command is more about external threats.) The **newly revamped interface** (Rapid7 has updated the UI post-acquisition) was called *“much better than before”* ([Threat Command by Rapid7 Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/threat-command-by-rapid7/reviews#:~:text=)). On the negative side, one user reported that sometimes Threat Command can surface irrelevant findings – *“an extra vulnerability that might not exactly relate to your application, and you end up researching it... only to know that it is not for you.”* ([Threat Command by Rapid7 Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/threat-command-by-rapid7/reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,Threat%20Command%20by%20Rapid7)). This suggests occasional false positives or intel that isn’t scoped correctly to the organization, which can consume analyst time. Another piece of feedback is that **policy and alert configurations can be complex** to set up optimally ([Threat Command by Rapid7 Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/threat-command-by-rapid7/reviews#:~:text=The%20platform%20is%20fairly%20easy,com)). Fine-tuning what you want to be alerted on (given the vast external data) may require some effort. In terms of value, users say Threat Command is solving the need for *“quick and easy security solutions”* to protect the organization’s external footprint ([Threat Command by Rapid7 Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/threat-command-by-rapid7/reviews#:~:text=What%20problems%20is%20Threat%20Command,how%20is%20that%20benefiting%20you)). Its benefits include clear monitoring of **dark web activity, leaked credentials, suspicious domains, and threat intel** relevant to the company ([Threat Command by Rapid7 Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/threat-command-by-rapid7/reviews#:~:text=What%20problems%20is%20Threat%20Command,how%20is%20that%20benefiting%20you)). In summary, Threat Command is seen as a powerful extension of security monitoring to external threats, with a user-friendly approach, though like any threat intel product it requires tuning to filter noise. Rapid7’s integration of IntSights seems to have maintained the core strengths (breadth of collection and ease of use) while working to improve the UI. 

## Rapid7 Metasploit – Penetration Testing Framework

**Description:** Metasploit is an open-source penetration testing framework, and Rapid7 is the custodian and primary contributor to the project since acquiring it in 2009 ([H. D. Moore - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Moore#:~:text=H.%20D.%20Moore%20,Rapid7%20has%20added%20commercial%20editions)). Metasploit is not a typical commercial product in the way others on this list are; rather, it’s a widely used toolkit for developing and executing exploit code against targets to validate vulnerabilities. Rapid7 offers **Metasploit Framework** for free (open-source) and had **Metasploit Pro** as a commercial edition with additional ease-of-use features (like wizards, web UI, and collaboration for penetration testers). Metasploit is deeply integrated into Rapid7’s ethos of offense-informed defense. For example, InsightVM can integrate with Metasploit to validate whether a found vulnerability is exploitable in the environment ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=Dashboards)). While Metasploit Pro was officially discontinued in late 2021 in favor of focusing on the open-core model, Rapid7 still provides support and updates to the framework. Metasploit provides thousands of exploit modules for known vulnerabilities, making it a valuable tool for red teams and penetration testers to simulate attacks and for defenders to verify their security. In Rapid7’s product lineup, Metasploit functions as a complementary tool – often used by security professionals in conjunction with InsightVM (for vulnerability validation) or as part of security assessments delivered by Rapid7’s consulting services.

**Pricing:** The **Metasploit Framework** is free to use under a BSD license. Rapid7’s now-retired **Metasploit Pro** (when it was sold) was a paid product that cost roughly on the order of $15,000 per user license annually in past years, but since it’s no longer actively sold, pricing is moot. Today, Rapid7 monetizes Metasploit indirectly: it enhances the value of InsightVM (through integration) and draws security practitioners into Rapid7’s community. There are no usage fees for Metasploit Framework, though using it effectively often requires expertise. Qualys doesn’t have a penetration testing tool; organizations might use Metasploit alongside Qualys to validate vulnerabilities found by Qualys scanners. The continued free availability of Metasploit is a differentiator for Rapid7 – it’s a significant contribution to the community and a lead generator for Rapid7’s commercial offerings.

**User Feedback:** Metasploit is beloved by penetration testers and is often referred to as the “industry standard” exploit framework. Users highlight that *“it is not just a tool but a toolkit”* containing all the required modules for exploitation ([Rapid7 Products | Read 229 Reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/sellers/rapid7#:~:text=)) ([Rapid7 Products | Read 229 Reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/sellers/rapid7#:~:text=)). Reviews on G2 and other platforms emphasize Metasploit’s flexibility – for example, *“we can create different types of payloads… like apk, exe, pdf etc.”* using the framework ([Rapid7 Products | Read 229 Reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/sellers/rapid7#:~:text=Review%20source%3A%20Organic)). In other words, it’s praised for the breadth of exploits and payload options it provides. As it is an open-source tool, formal “support” is via the community, and documentation can sometimes be technical. Some users note that Metasploit’s command-line nature has a learning curve for newcomers. However, within its space, it’s regarded as **the best exploitation framework** – a user review explicitly states *“Metasploit is the best tool for creating payloads and exploiting systems”* ([Rapid7 Products | Read 229 Reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/sellers/rapid7#:~:text=Review%20source%3A%20Organic)). Rapid7’s stewardship means the tool gets regular updates for new vulnerabilities, which users certainly appreciate. In summary, Metasploit’s “user feedback” is evidenced by its ubiquity in the pen-testing community. It’s a core tool in many security professionals’ arsenal, valued for its power and versatility. The fact that Rapid7 maintains this tool as free and open has positively influenced its brand reputation.

## Rapid7 Services (Managed and Professional Services)

In addition to software products, Rapid7 offers a range of services to help organizations that need additional security expertise or outsourcing of certain functions. These services leverage Rapid7’s technology but also provide human expertise. Key services include:

- **Managed Detection and Response (MDR)**: Marketed as **Managed Threat Complete (MXDR)**, Rapid7’s MDR service provides 24x7 monitoring, threat detection, and incident response by Rapid7’s analysts using InsightIDR and Threat Command on the customer’s behalf ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=,Continuous%20Red%20Teaming%20VECTOR%20COMMAND)). This service is popular with organizations that lack a full in-house SOC. Rapid7’s MDR was recognized as a “Strong Performer” in Forrester’s MDR Wave 2023 ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=Rapid7%20Named%20a%20Strong%20Performer,Managed%20Detection%20and%20Response%20Report)). Packages typically scale by number of assets or log sources; pricing is asset-based (often cited between ~$10–$30 per asset per month for MDR services in industry benchmarks) ([MDR Pricing | Managed Detection & Response Cost in 2024](https://underdefense.com/mdr-pricing/#:~:text=MDR%20Pricing%20,depending%20on%20your%20specific%20requirements)) ([Comparing Managed Detection and Response Services - BitLyft](https://www.bitlyft.com/resources/comparing-the-top-managed-detection-and-response-mdr-services#:~:text=Comparing%20Managed%20Detection%20and%20Response,based%2C%20and%20both%20offerings)). Rapid7 even offers active threat containment as part of MDR – for example, isolating compromised endpoints. The MDR service has options (Essentials vs. Elite) to cater to different organization sizes and needs ([Comparing Managed Detection and Response Services - BitLyft](https://www.bitlyft.com/resources/comparing-the-top-managed-detection-and-response-mdr-services#:~:text=Comparing%20Managed%20Detection%20and%20Response,based%2C%20and%20both%20offerings)).

- **Managed Vulnerability Management**: Rapid7 can run your InsightVM program for you, doing asset scanning, assessment, and reporting as a managed service ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=,Continuous%20Red%20Teaming%20VECTOR%20COMMAND)). This is useful for companies that want the benefits of a vulnerability management program but don’t have dedicated staff to manage it. Rapid7 analysts will operate InsightVM, validate critical findings, and deliver guidance for remediation on an ongoing basis.

- **Managed Application Security (DAST as a Service)**: Similarly, Rapid7’s team can manage InsightAppSec scans, interpret results, and help developers fix issues ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=,Continuous%20Red%20Teaming%20VECTOR%20COMMAND)). This offloads the work from the client. Rapid7 calls this **Managed AppSec** (or “Managed DAST”).

- **Continuous Red Teaming (CRT)**: Branded as **“Vector Command”**, this is an offering where Rapid7 conducts continuous adversary simulations and attack exercises against a customer’s environment ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=,Continuous%20Red%20Teaming%20VECTOR%20COMMAND)). It’s like having an ongoing red team to test your defenses beyond one-off pentests. This service likely uses tools like Metasploit, custom malware, and manual tester expertise to find gaps that automated scanners might miss.

- **Penetration Testing Services**: Rapid7’s consulting team offers one-time or periodic penetration tests and security assessments ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=,Continuous%20Red%20Teaming%20VECTOR%20COMMAND)). These can range from network and application pentests to social engineering engagements. Given Rapid7’s roots (the company started with a focus on pentest tools and services), their consulting is well-established. Clients often engage Rapid7 for objective third-party assessments required for compliance or just to proactively uncover vulnerabilities.

- **Incident Response Services**: In the event of a breach, Rapid7’s IR services can provide emergency breach assistance and investigations ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=,Continuous%20Red%20Teaming%20VECTOR%20COMMAND)). They help contain attacks and perform forensics. This service line often works hand-in-hand with Rapid7’s Velociraptor DFIR tool (acquired in 2021), which allows deep forensic data collection from endpoints ([Rapid7 Acquires IntSights for $335M for External Threat Intelligence](https://www.datamation.com/security/rapid7-intsights-acquisition/#:~:text=Rapid7%20Acquires%20IntSights%20for%20%24335M,and%20community%20for%20endpoint)). Organizations can retain Rapid7 for “incident response retainers” to ensure help is available quickly if needed.

- **Advisory Services and Training**: Rapid7 also provides strategic consulting (e.g., security program development, risk assessment, red team/blue team exercises) and training & certification for their products ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=Service%20and%20training)). They run a **Rapid7 Academy** and offer certifications for practitioners on InsightVM, InsightIDR, etc.

**User Feedback on Services:** Rapid7’s services are generally well-regarded for the expertise of their staff. In Gartner Peer Insights, Rapid7 MDR has been noted for strong customer engagement. Rapid7’s MDR was mentioned as having active support and quick resolution of issues, with high customer satisfaction according to one SOAR platforms review (indirectly referencing G2 feedback where Rapid7’s support is “active”) ([AWS Marketplace: Rapid7 Insight Platform Reviews - Amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/reviews/reviews-list/prodview-aklm7wpok4nra#:~:text=AWS%20Marketplace%3A%20Rapid7%20Insight%20Platform,What%20do)) ([Rapid7 InsightConnect Reviews, Ratings & Features 2025 - Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/security-orchestration-automation-and-response-solutions/vendor/rapid7/product/insightconnect#:~:text=Gartner%20www,tied%20to%20the%20R7)). One G2 review of a combined Rapid7 offering noted that the package (InsightVM + InsightCloudSec + InsightConnect under an Essentials license) was *“absolutely value for money”* ([Rapid7 Products | Read 229 Reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/sellers/rapid7#:~:text=)), implying that Rapid7’s bundling of products and services meets customer needs cost-effectively. However, that same review carried a title suggesting Rapid7 could “create more problems than it solves” – likely referring to some challenges in deployment or support, but the snippet we have is the positive portion about value ([Rapid7 Products | Read 229 Reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/sellers/rapid7#:~:text=)). On the managed services front, Rapid7 has been recognized by analysts as well: for example, Rapid7 was named a “Leader” in The Forrester Wave for Midsize Managed Security Service Providers 2020 ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=)), reflecting strong performance for its target market. The **bottom line** is that Rapid7’s services augment their software – organizations that use the Insight platform often praise the combination of tooling with Rapid7’s team to back it up. This integration of service and software is a trend in the industry (Qualys, in contrast, relies more on partners for services, whereas Rapid7 directly offers them).

# Rapid7 vs Qualys: Competitive Analysis

Rapid7 and Qualys are often compared as they both offer vulnerability management and a suite of security solutions, but there are key differences in their product breadth, approach, and target markets. Below is a detailed comparison across features, usability, integrations, coverage, and other factors, including how each caters to various organization sizes and geographies.

## Product Portfolio and Feature Coverage

**Vulnerability Management:** Both Rapid7 and Qualys are leaders in vulnerability management, but their approaches differ. **Qualys VMDR (Vulnerability Management, Detection, and Response)** is a cloud-based platform known for comprehensive scanning and compliance features. It not only finds vulnerabilities but also includes configuration/security compliance scanning and has a patch management module. **Rapid7 InsightVM**, on the other hand, focuses on risk prioritization – it incorporates attacker analytics (like exploitability via Metasploit, threat feeds, etc.) to rank vulns for remediation ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=Dashboards)). Rapid7 also provides features like Remediation Projects and live dashboards, which users find helpful for tracking progress ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20like%20best,Nexpose)) ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20like%20best,Nexpose)). Qualys is often praised for thoroughness and breadth – for instance, it can perform **authenticated scanning** deeply and check against various compliance benchmarks out-of-the-box. One peer comparison notes Qualys is *“comprehensive, including compliance and web app scanning”* as part of its cloud platform ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=Qualys%3A)). Rapid7 covers compliance too (InsightVM has CIS benchmark checks, etc.), but Qualys Policy Compliance is a dedicated module that some large enterprises rely on heavily for audit purposes.

**Application Security:** Qualys offers **Web Application Scanning (WAS)** and a **Web Application Firewall (WAF) service**, whereas Rapid7 offers **InsightAppSec** (DAST) and **tCell** (RASP). Qualys WAS and Rapid7 InsightAppSec are fairly equivalent in DAST capabilities (both can scan web apps for OWASP Top 10 issues). Rapid7 was named a **Visionary in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing 2021** ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=Rapid7%20Named%20a%20Visionary%20in,Quadrant%20for%20Application%20Security%20Testing)), reflecting strong innovation (likely due to features like attack replay and InsightAppSec’s modern app support). Qualys WAS is solid but Qualys is not cited as a leader in AST Magic Quadrants, often considered a niche player for app scanning. Rapid7’s addition of tCell RASP gives it an edge in runtime protection – Qualys does not have a RASP solution. However, Qualys has added ***Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)*** recently to its portfolio (via an optional module), whereas Rapid7 currently relies on DAST+RASP combination.

**Cloud Security:** Qualys and Rapid7 both address cloud security but with different scopes. Rapid7 InsightCloudSec (DivvyCloud) is a full-featured **CSPM** with some cloud workload protection elements. Qualys has **Cloud Security Assessment (CSA)** and **CloudView** for CSPM, plus container and Kubernetes security solutions. Qualys’ approach is to extend its single agent and scanner model to cloud – Qualys can parse cloud configurations and also scan cloud hosts for vulnerabilities. Qualys also acquired Layered Insight for container security, so it offers container image scanning and runtime container defense. Rapid7’s InsightCloudSec is considered very strong in **compliance and governance for multi-cloud** environments ([Rapid7 InsightCloudSec Reviews, Ratings & Features 2025 - Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/cloud-security-posture-management-tools/vendor/rapid7/product/insightcloudsec#:~:text=Rapid7%20InsightCloudSec%20Reviews%2C%20Ratings%20%26,Benchmarks%2C%20Cost%20containment%20packs%2C)). In a community discussion, a professional described InsightCloudSec (DivvyCloud) as **“CSPM 1.0”** – good for finding misconfigs but *“you can get a lot of that functionality using cloud native tools”*, and not as advanced in cloud workload protection ([Has anyone tested Rapid7's cloud security offerings? : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/vgaom0/has_anyone_tested_rapid7s_cloud_security_offerings/#:~:text=A%20lot%20of%20this%20can,made%20for%20dynamic%20cloud%20environments)) ([Has anyone tested Rapid7's cloud security offerings? : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/vgaom0/has_anyone_tested_rapid7s_cloud_security_offerings/#:~:text=scanners%20in%20the%20cloud%2C%20that%E2%80%99s,made%20for%20dynamic%20cloud%20environments)). They suggested newer players (like Wiz) have an edge in cloud-native coverage. Qualys’s cloud offerings are also regarded as a bit behind those cloud-specific startups, but Qualys has an advantage of integration – Qualys can tie cloud asset inventory to on-prem inventory seamlessly in its platform. Both Qualys and Rapid7 support Infrastructure as Code scanning (Rapid7 does via DivvyCloud’s IaC module, Qualys via its CloudView policies).

**Endpoint Security & XDR:** Qualys is not an XDR or SIEM provider – it partners or relies on third parties for that. Rapid7 provides InsightIDR for SIEM/XDR. So if an organization wants an integrated SIEM + VM, Rapid7 offers that in-house, whereas Qualys would require using a separate SIEM (Splunk, etc.). On endpoint detection, Qualys does have an **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** product (Qualys Multi-Vector EDR) which leverages its agent to detect endpoint threats. But Qualys EDR is relatively new and not as widely adopted as dedicated EDR tools. Rapid7’s detection is centered in InsightIDR which uses the same agent primarily for telemetry (it’s more a SIEM that ingests endpoint data rather than a traditional EDR doing low-level blocking). Thus, Rapid7’s focus is SIEM+UBA, Qualys’ focus is vulnerability+compliance, with some overlap but different strengths.

**Threat Intelligence:** Rapid7 (Threat Command) offers external threat intel monitoring, which Qualys does not provide. Qualys tends to partner for threat intel (or use open source feeds in its platform for things like vulnerability prioritization). Rapid7’s Threat Command can be a differentiator for organizations concerned about dark web monitoring, brand protection, etc., whereas Qualys customers might need a separate vendor for that capability.

**Device Coverage:** Both platforms cover servers, workstations, cloud VMs, containers. Qualys extends to network devices (it can scan network gear for vulnerabilities and compliance). Rapid7 can scan network devices with InsightVM too, but Qualys has specialized content for things like Cisco configs, which historically set it apart. For emerging tech: Qualys has modules for Mobile Device security (via integration) and even IoT security in some form, whereas Rapid7’s Mobilisafe from 2012 was an early mobile risk tool that isn’t visible now. Rapid7 seems to have not pursued mobile device assessment post-2012, focusing instead on endpoint agent approach.

**Breadth vs Depth:** Qualys prides itself on a broad platform with many modules (VM, Policy Compliance, Container Security, Web App Scanning, Patch Management, File Integrity Monitoring, Database security, etc.) all unified in the Qualys Cloud Platform. Rapid7 has fewer product lines but focuses on depth and integration within those (and relies on integrations for some functions like patching). For example, **patching**: Qualys Patch Management can deploy patches to certain OS/apps directly from the console. Rapid7’s InsightVM doesn’t apply patches itself; instead it integrates with solutions like Microsoft SCCM or Intune to streamline remediation, or simply provides guidance/tracking. So Qualys offers more “one-stop-shop” features, whereas Rapid7 emphasizes connecting with existing IT ops tools.

## Usability and User Experience

Rapid7 is often praised for a more modern and user-friendly interface, while Qualys is sometimes viewed as powerful but complex. In a Reddit discussion summarizing tools, **Rapid7 was noted for its “user-friendly interface”** and ease of navigation ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=Rapid7%3A)). Users frequently mention that Rapid7’s Insight platform UI is intuitive – for instance, the InsightVM dashboards and InsightIDR interface are point-and-click with a logical flow that “makes vulnerability management incredibly simple” (as one G2 reviewer noted) ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=I%27ve%20used%20this%20product%20for,Comparatively%20speaking%20to)). Rapid7 also offers features like an interactive query language for logs that’s considered easier than legacy SIEM query languages.

Qualys, on the other hand, has improved its UI over the years (they introduced a new GUI around 2018 and have been refining it), but it still can feel overwhelming due to the sheer number of options and modules. A user observation was that Qualys’s **“interface can be complex for new users.”** ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=Qualys%3A)) There is often a steeper learning curve to understand Qualys asset tagging, subscription scope, module enablement, etc. Some Qualys users have complained about the old-fashioned feel of certain workflows and the need to navigate multiple menus to get things done. Documentation for Qualys is thorough but can be dense; and anecdotally, some have found Qualys’s **support and documentation to be less helpful** in guiding new users ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)).

Rapid7 also emphasizes visualization – InsightVM’s live dashboards and InsightIDR’s investigation timelines are frequently lauded as easy to interpret. Qualys provides a lot of data but in tabular or report form that sometimes requires external tools for pretty visualization. However, Qualys has strong reporting (especially compliance reports that auditors appreciate). 

One concrete example: creating a custom report or dashboard. In Rapid7 InsightVM, a user can drag-and-drop widgets in a live dashboard and share it easily ([FAQs: InsightVM Dashboards & Executive Summary Report - Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2020/05/20/q-a-from-april-2020-customer-webcast-on-insightvm-dashboards-executive-summary-report/#:~:text=InsightVM%20dashboards%20are%20shareable%20with,In%20order%20to)). In Qualys, a user might need to create a static report or use Qualys’s query language (QQL) to build a dashboard – powerful but less straightforward.

User feedback underscores these points: Rapid7 customers often mention **“intuitive UI”**, while Qualys customers might say **“powerful but not very user-friendly.”** For instance, in Gartner Peer Insights, Qualys VM is highly rated on capabilities but occasionally gets dinged on **ease-of-use for beginners**. In contrast, Rapid7 InsightVM is described as **“a powerful but expensive VM tool with [complexity] for smaller businesses”** ([Rapid7 InsightVM Reviews, Ratings & Features 2025 - Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/vulnerability-assessment/vendor/rapid7/product/insightvm#:~:text=Rapid7%20InsightVM%20Reviews%2C%20Ratings%20%26,with%20complex%20for%20smaller%20businesses)) – suggesting that if anything, complexity in Rapid7 might show up when a very small org with limited IT tries to use an enterprise-grade tool, but generally mid-size users find it straightforward.

## Integration and Automation Capabilities

When it comes to integrating with other tools and enabling workflows, Rapid7 has a distinct advantage with InsightConnect (SOAR) being part of its platform. **Rapid7’s integrations are often plug-and-play** through the Extensions library ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=,Documentation%20PRODUCT%20AND%20SERVICES%20GUIDES)) ([Rapid7 Product Pricing: The Starting Cost of Our Insight Products](https://www.rapid7.com/pricing/#:~:text=,Central%20account%20dashboard)). For example, Rapid7 provides pre-built integrations to ServiceNow for ticketing, to Jira, Splunk, AWS, etc., and these can be deployed easily. Through InsightConnect, Rapid7 offers many “workflow templates” – say, automatically create a Jira ticket for a new critical vuln, or enrich an InsightIDR alert with threat intelligence – that can be turned on with minimal coding. This means a lot of Rapid7 integrations can be achieved **without custom development**, using either built-in capabilities or the SOAR library. A user highlighted the **“out-of-the-box connectors”** as a key strength of InsightConnect ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20like%20best,about%20InsightConnect)). Additionally, data is shared across Rapid7’s products (the Insight Platform’s unified data model): for instance, assets discovered by InsightVM feed into InsightIDR’s context, and vulnerabilities from InsightVM can be seen in InsightCloudSec for cloud hosts, etc., providing a more unified view.

Qualys integrates primarily through its API. Qualys has a robust set of APIs for all its modules, and they also provide some native integrations (for example, a Qualys App for Splunk to import vulnerability data, or a ServiceNow Vulnerability Response integration). However, setting these up might require an administrator to configure API access and mappings. Qualys does not have a built-in SOAR, so **automating responses** (like network isolation of a vulnerable host) would require external scripting or an external SOAR platform. Many Qualys customers develop custom scripts or use tools like Python (the Qualys API is well-documented) to pull data and push into other systems. Qualys has a marketplace (Qualys Developer Portal) where community and partners share scripts or tools, but it’s not as turnkey as Rapid7’s one-click workflows. 

For third-party tool integration: both Qualys and Rapid7 integrate with ticketing systems (Qualys has modules for ServiceNow, Cherwell; Rapid7 for ServiceNow, Jira, etc.). Both integrate with CI/CD: Qualys can plug into Jenkins to trigger scans, Rapid7 can as well (AppSec plugin for Jenkins, etc.). The key difference is **level of effort**. For Qualys, one might need to orchestrate the sequence: e.g., use Qualys API to fetch a report and then feed to Jenkins or an internal tool. With Rapid7, InsightConnect could orchestrate that sequence with a pre-built workflow.

**Custom development:** If an environment has unusual integration needs, both platforms allow custom development. Qualys API can be coded against in any language. Rapid7 InsightConnect allows writing custom plugins (in Python) if needed. Users have noted that for Rapid7’s automation, knowing a scripting language helps for advanced cases ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect/reviews#reviews#:~:text=The%20user,as%20specified%20in%20the%20overall)), implying that while many tasks are point-and-click, complex integrations might require custom script within InsightConnect. So, neither is completely code-free for all scenarios, but Rapid7 tries to cover the most common scenarios with ready-made solutions.

**Ecosystem:** Qualys’s ecosystem historically includes many tech partners (SIEMs, ITSM, etc.), and QualysGuard was often integrated into larger workflows via third-party tools in large enterprises. Rapid7’s ecosystem, thanks to InsightConnect and an open extension interface, has grown too. Rapid7 also open-sources some integration code (like the InsightConnect plugin scripts are often on GitHub). 

In summary, **Rapid7 provides more native integration and automation capabilities** (especially beneficial for teams without a separate SOAR solution), whereas **Qualys provides comprehensive APIs and relies on customers or partners to build automation**. This means that if you need a high degree of security workflow automation and you want it “out-of-the-box,” Rapid7 is attractive. If you have a mature operations team that can script and you prefer the highly configurable API-driven approach, Qualys is fine but will need that development effort. One user comparison noted Rapid7’s advantage here, stating *“Rapid7 unites your technology by automating workflows”* easily, but also cautioning that without scripting knowledge you might hit limits ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect/reviews#reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,InsightConnect)). Qualys users often comment that once integrated, the data quality is excellent, but getting there is the hardest part (with some complaining about patchy documentation for integrations, as noted in a Reddit thread about Qualys support) ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)).

## Usability for Small vs Large Organizations

**Small Businesses:** Smaller organizations (say with an IT team of one to five people and a few hundred assets) often prefer solutions that are easy to deploy and manage with limited resources. Rapid7 has an edge here with cloud-hosted products that require minimal infrastructure and a more guided user experience. InsightVM, for instance, can be up and running quickly with the InsightAgent and a scan engine, and the user can rely on the default dashboards and risk scoring to drive action. For a small org, Qualys VMDR might feel overwhelming – Qualys has many options and the user might not use 80% of them. Also, Qualys licensing historically started at a higher price point (Qualys wasn’t very SMB-focused until recent years). Rapid7, despite being enterprise-capable, actively markets to mid-market and smaller enterprises, often highlighting time-to-value. That said, Rapid7’s pricing for SIEM (InsightIDR) can be a barrier for very small orgs (a small org might find $5.89/asset/month for SIEM too costly if they have hundreds of assets and little budget ([InsightIDR Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightidr/reviews#:~:text=What%20do%20you%20dislike%20about,InsightIDR))). Qualys does offer a free trial and even a free edition for up to 16 IPs for vulnerability management, which tiny organizations or startups could use – Rapid7’s trials are time-limited rather than free tier.

Real user feedback indicates that **Rapid7 is perceived as easier for newcomers**. In one comparison, a user mentioned *“if you’re starting from scratch…Tenable would be easier [than Rapid7 or Qualys] because it is widely used”* with lots of documentation ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=Personally%20have%20used%20all%20Tenable%2C,lots%20of%20documentation%20for%20beginners)), but another mentioned *“Rapid7: known for its user-friendly interface”* which implies new users can navigate it readily ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=Rapid7%3A)). Qualys’s interface complexity can be a hurdle for small teams without dedicated security specialists ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=Qualys%3A)). Also, Qualys support being “awful” as one user put it ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)) could hurt a small business that relies on vendor help, whereas Rapid7’s support is generally reviewed positively (Rapid7 is often cited for responsive customer success).

**Mid-sized Organizations:** For mid-market (say 500–5,000 employees), both Rapid7 and Qualys are viable. This segment often has some IT/security staff, but not huge teams. Rapid7’s all-in-one “Insight” platform can be attractive as it consolidates capabilities (VM, SIEM, etc.) without needing separate siloed products. Qualys can also serve mid-market well, but often mid-sized companies might not utilize all of Qualys’s modules due to resource constraints (for example, they might only use VM and WAS). Cost-wise, both vendors will negotiate bundles. Qualys might bundle VM, PC, WAS for a mid-market client; Rapid7 might bundle InsightVM + IDR + maybe AppSec in a deal (like their “Essentials” license that one G2 review mentioned including three products at good value) ([Rapid7 Products | Read 229 Reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/sellers/rapid7#:~:text=)). Mid-sized companies have reported success with both: e.g., a mid-market user of InsightVM said it *“helps us stay safe from cyber attacks and reduce risk”* with timely patching ([InsightVM (Nexpose) Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightvm-nexpose/reviews#:~:text=What%20problems%20is%20InsightVM%20,how%20is%20that%20benefiting%20you)), whereas a mid-market user of Qualys might praise how comprehensive the scanning is once set up. A key differentiator is **headcount** – Rapid7 often pitches that you can run their solutions **without adding headcount** ([InsightIDR Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightidr/reviews#:~:text=response,response%20program%20without%20adding%20headcount)), owing to cloud management and simpler UI. Qualys might require a part-time or full-time admin who becomes a “Qualys guard” expert to fully leverage it, which mid-sized firms may or may not have.

**Large Enterprises:** Large organizations (with tens of thousands of assets globally) have historically gravitated to Qualys (and Tenable) for vulnerability management due to scalability and longevity in the market. Qualys’s platform is proven at massive scale – some of the world’s largest companies and governments use Qualys to scan hundreds of thousands of IPs. Qualys’s design as a multi-tenant cloud from early on gave it a scalability advantage (e.g., external scanning, ability to distribute scanners, etc.). Rapid7 InsightVM can also scale (especially with the agent-based approach offloading a lot of continuous data), and we see many large enterprises in Rapid7’s customer list too. But one consideration is the **breadth of needs in a large enterprise**: they may require things like granular role-based access control, multiple user roles across business units, very fine-tuned compliance reporting for various regulations, etc. Qualys has mature features for these (for example, asset tagging and scoping so different teams only see their assets, very granular roles, etc.). Rapid7’s platform also has RBAC and tagging, but some large-org features might not be as granular. For instance, Qualys allows segmentation of subscription into multiple Business Units with separate data segregation – helpful in a giant company or MSSP scenario. Rapid7 tends to operate on a single tenant per customer model (with tag-based scoping for teams).

In terms of **enterprise adoption**, Qualys and Rapid7 are both considered leaders in vulnerability management by analysts. The **Forrester Wave for Vulnerability Risk Management Q3 2023** placed Qualys as a Leader and Rapid7 as a Strong Performer ([Rapid7 doubles down on a platform approach for Vulnerability Risk ...](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/09/20/rapid7-doubles-down-on-a-platform-approach-for-vulnerability-risk-management/#:~:text=,Vulnerability%20Risk%20Management%2C%20Q3%202023)). Forrester noted Rapid7’s solution is powerful but might lag slightly in strategy or breadth compared to Qualys/Tenable which were leaders. Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice often included Qualys and Rapid7 both highly rated by large customers. One Gartner Peer Insights review snippet described Rapid7 InsightVM as *“a powerhouse of vulnerability management”* but *“complex for smaller businesses”*, implying it’s well-suited for bigger orgs ([Rapid7 InsightVM Reviews, Ratings & Features 2025 - Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/vulnerability-assessment/vendor/rapid7/product/insightvm#:~:text=Rapid7%20InsightVM%20Reviews%2C%20Ratings%20%26,with%20complex%20for%20smaller%20businesses)). Qualys similarly is known to be very powerful but can be *“overkill for small orgs”* – something mirrored in user forums.

Large enterprises also consider **ecosystem and vendor stability**. Both Qualys and Rapid7 are well-established (public companies, around 20+ years in business). Qualys, being solely focused on enterprise security platform, sometimes touts that all development is in-house and tightly integrated (no major acquired products until recent years). Rapid7’s platform has more acquired components (though well integrated now). To a large enterprise with conservative approach, Qualys’s unified platform might seem less risky change-wise. To another enterprise, Rapid7’s innovation pace (adding cloud, SOAR, etc.) might be appealing.

## Global Presence and Geographic Adoption

Both Rapid7 and Qualys are global companies with customers across North America, EMEA, and APAC. Qualys, founded in 1999, was a pioneer in cloud-based security and expanded globally early (multiple scanning datacenters in USA, Europe, India, Japan, etc., to support local scanning and data sovereignty). Qualys has large partners and resellers worldwide and is known to be used in many multinational corporations. It also has a strong presence in sectors like financial services and government; for example, QualysGuard is approved for compliance scanning (PCI ASV) globally, and many international firms standardized on Qualys for its broad compliance features.

Rapid7 (founded 2000) is headquartered in Boston, MA, and expanded internationally later. It now has offices in EMEA and APAC, and its cloud infrastructure for the Insight platform has regional options (e.g., hosting in the US or EU for compliance). Rapid7’s customer base historically was very strong in North America and growing in Europe. It has been expanding in Asia-Pacific as well, albeit Qualys has a notable office in Pune (India) with many engineers and thus a presence in that market. Rapid7’s **global services** (MDR, etc.) operate 24/7 with teams in Boston, Ireland, and Australia, covering all time zones.

In terms of adoption by geography: There isn’t public data on exact market share, but anecdotally **Qualys has been entrenched in many large European and Asian enterprises** longer, partly via partnerships with global system integrators. Rapid7 in recent years has gained a lot of European customers, especially with cloud-delivered Insight products reducing concerns about on-prem deployment. Rapid7’s participation in international compliance (such as being GDPR-ready, etc.) has improved its appeal in regulated environments in Europe. A news item shows Rapid7 expanding presence – e.g., opening a larger office in Belfast and a new facility in Tampa for support ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=Rapid7%20Announces%20Expanded%20U,in%20Tampa)) – showing their investment in broader support coverage.

One can also see adoption via Gartner Magic Quadrant context: Qualys was consistently a Leader in the now-retired MQ for Vulnerability Management (often the most top-right among vendors for completeness of vision and ability to execute). Rapid7 was also typically a Leader or close (occasionally a Challenger in older MQs). Gartner’s “Voice of the Customer” for vulnerability management in 2020 recognized Rapid7 with a Customers’ Choice badge ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=)), indicating strong global customer satisfaction. Qualys also usually enjoys high ratings, but some users in Asia have sometimes cited latency issues or support delays with Qualys since support might be out of a different time zone. Rapid7’s MDR service being global means customers in, say, Europe, get local language and regional support at times, which can be a factor for adoption.

Overall, **Qualys and Rapid7 both have global reach**, but Qualys might have a slight edge in certain regions (Qualys has been the de facto standard for many APAC financial institutions, for instance, due to partnerships and long-standing presence). Rapid7’s community (through open-source Metasploit, etc.) gives it a global fanbase too. For organizations with data residency needs, Qualys’s platform being in many local datacenters can be a plus; Rapid7 may have fewer regional datacenter choices, but it does offer at least US and EU hosting.

## Competitive Differentiators Summary

To crystallize the differences:

- **Features:** Qualys offers an expansive suite covering VM, compliance, container security, patching, etc., all under one platform. Rapid7 offers a slightly narrower but well-integrated set focusing on VM, SIEM, SOAR, cloud, and appsec. If an organization needs SIEM/XDR and SOAR, Rapid7 provides that in-house, whereas Qualys would require third-party solutions for those areas.

- **Usability:** Rapid7 tends to win on **ease-of-use and UI** especially for those without dedicated security engineers. Qualys tends to win on **depth of features** and customization, which seasoned practitioners can leverage (at the expense of a learning curve). As one user succinctly put it: *“Qualys: comprehensive… but interface can be complex. Rapid7: user-friendly… great risk prioritization.”* ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=Rapid7%3A)) ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=Qualys%3A)).

- **Integrations:** Rapid7 has **native automation and integration (SOAR)** included, meaning common integrations are ready to go and complex workflows can be automated internally. Qualys has **extensive APIs** and some built integrations, but achieving the same level of orchestration often requires custom work or an external SOAR. This means integration speed is faster with Rapid7 in many cases, which can be crucial for organizations looking to streamline security operations.

- **Scalability:** Both scale to large enterprises, but Qualys has a longer track record at massive scale (millions of scans, global assets) and very fine-grained multi-tenant controls. Rapid7 scales well too (some very large firms use InsightVM and InsightIDR), and with the InsightAgent they reduce scan bottlenecks. There’s little issue using either for thousands of assets – but extremely distributed environments might like Qualys’s lightweight cloud scanner appliance approach, whereas Rapid7’s engine + agent combo is different in architecture. 

- **Small vs Big:** Rapid7’s offerings are often seen as more accessible to mid-market without needing a big team (e.g., MDR for those who can’t staff a SOC, easy UI for one-person IT security teams). Qualys can certainly be used by mid-market, but often those customers might only tap part of its capability. For very large organizations with specialized needs (like separate risk scoring models, custom integrations into mega-sized ITSM systems, etc.), Qualys’s flexibility and long enterprise experience can be a plus.

- **Geography and Support:** Both have global support. Qualys support has mixed reviews from users (some cite delays or scripted responses). Rapid7’s support generally gets favorable mentions (fast, hands-on). In one user’s words about Rapid7: *“you know you’ll get excellent service”* ([InsightConnect Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2](https://www.g2.com/products/insightconnect/reviews#reviews#:~:text=the%20mundane,com)). For a global org, Rapid7’s support presence in multiple continents (US, EU, APAC) ensures 24x7 follow-the-sun support, which Qualys also provides but often from core locations.

- **Analyst/Market Perspective:** Qualys is often viewed as a stalwart and *“Leader”* in vulnerability management by analysts (e.g., Forrester and previously Gartner MQ). Rapid7 is viewed as an *innovator* that also consistently ranks high. In the **2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for SIEM**, Rapid7 was named a Leader (for InsightIDR) ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=)), whereas Qualys is absent there due to no SIEM. In the **2023 Forrester Wave for VRM**, Rapid7 and Qualys were both in strong positions (Qualys likely among leaders, Rapid7 strong performer) ([Rapid7 doubles down on a platform approach for Vulnerability Risk ...](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/09/20/rapid7-doubles-down-on-a-platform-approach-for-vulnerability-risk-management/#:~:text=,Vulnerability%20Risk%20Management%2C%20Q3%202023)). Both vendors are thus seen as top-tier, with differences coming down to company needs and preferences.

In conclusion, organizations that want a **one-stop cloud security platform mostly focused on vulnerability and compliance** (and are willing to invest time to master it) often lean toward **Qualys**. Those that want a **broader security operations platform (including detection and automation)** with a more **unified and user-friendly experience** often choose **Rapid7**. For many, it’s not either-or: some large enterprises use Qualys for VM and also use Rapid7 InsightIDR for SIEM, for example. But when directly comparing Rapid7 vs Qualys for overlapping capabilities (like VM), the differences above become key deciding factors. As one comparative assessment noted: Rapid7 InsightVM provides **excellent risk prioritization and ease of use**, while Qualys provides **extensive coverage and scalability**, so the choice hinges on whether usability or granular coverage is the higher priority ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=Rapid7%3A)) ([Rapid7 vs Tenable vs Qualys vs Crowdstrike for Vulnerability Management - Insights Needed! : r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1daplac/rapid7_vs_tenable_vs_qualys_vs_crowdstrike_for/#:~:text=Qualys%3A)).

# Market Recognition and Analyst Insights

Both Rapid7 and Qualys have earned significant recognition in the cybersecurity industry and are frequently evaluated by independent analysts. Here we summarize some recent studies and reports that shed light on their standings:

- **Gartner Magic Quadrant for SIEM (2024)** – Rapid7 was named a **Challenger** (on the cusp of Leaders quadrant) for its InsightIDR SIEM, indicating high ability to execute and a strong, innovative vision ([Rapid7 Recognized in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for SIEM](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/05/13/rapid7-recognized-in-the-2024-gartner-r-magic-quadrant-for-siem/#:~:text=Rapid7%20Recognized%20in%20the%202024,Gartner%20Magic%20Quadrant%20for%20SIEM)). This was the second consecutive year Rapid7 was recognized in the SIEM Magic Quadrant as a Challenger/Leader. Gartner noted strengths in cloud deployment and user behavior analytics for Rapid7. Qualys, not offering a SIEM, does not appear in this MQ. 

- **Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing (2022)** – Rapid7 was positioned as a **Visionary** for its application security offerings (InsightAppSec and tCell) ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=Rapid7%20Named%20a%20Visionary%20for,Quadrant%E2%84%A2%20for%20Application%20Security%20Testing)) ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=Rapid7%20Named%20a%20Visionary%20in,Quadrant%20for%20Application%20Security%20Testing)). This reflects Rapid7’s innovative features like attack replay and integrated app protection, though its AST market share is smaller compared to dedicated AST vendors. Qualys (with WAS) was typically considered a niche player in AST and was not in the Visionary/Leader category in that space.

- **Forrester Wave: Vulnerability Risk Management (Q3 2023)** – Qualys and Rapid7 both featured strongly. According to Rapid7, they were named a **“Strong Performer”** in this Wave ([Rapid7 doubles down on a platform approach for Vulnerability Risk ...](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/09/20/rapid7-doubles-down-on-a-platform-approach-for-vulnerability-risk-management/#:~:text=,Vulnerability%20Risk%20Management%2C%20Q3%202023)). Qualys is generally perceived as a Leader in VRM Waves (Forrester’s 2021 VRM Wave had Qualys as a Leader, for example, alongside Tenable). The Wave commentary often praises Qualys for an unparalleled breadth of coverage and a single-agent architecture, while Rapid7 gets credit for excellent usability and integration across the security lifecycle (from vuln detection to response). However, Rapid7’s slightly lower placement might be due to things like lack of a built-in patching solution or certain advanced analytics, whereas Qualys might score lower on current execution in newer areas like DevOps integration.

- **Gartner Peer Insights – Voice of the Customer (2020)** – In 2020, Rapid7 InsightVM was recognized as a **Customers’ Choice** in the Voice of the Customer report for Vulnerability Assessment tools ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=)), meaning it had high ratings and recommendation levels from end users (above 4.5 stars average). Qualys also had strong customer reviews (typically in the 4.5 stars range) but I recall in 2020 Qualys just missed the cut due to Gartner’s inclusion criteria or lower survey volume; nonetheless, Qualys’s customer sentiment is also positive, often noting its reliability and coverage. Peer reviews often cite Qualys’s longevity and trust (it’s a go-to for many), and Rapid7’s focus on customer success (with hands-on support and an engaged community).

- **Managed Services Recognition** – Rapid7’s MDR service has gotten notice in analyst reports. Forrester’s MDR Wave 2021 cited Rapid7 as a Strong Performer ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=Rapid7%20Named%20a%20Strong%20Performer,Managed%20Detection%20and%20Response%20Report)). Additionally, Rapid7 was named a **Leader in Forrester’s 2020 Wave for Midsize MSSPs** ([Press Releases: The Latest Rapid7 News](https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/#:~:text=)), reflecting its strength in servicing mid-market clients with managed offerings. Qualys, by contrast, doesn’t provide these services directly, so it’s not in those evaluations; instead, MSSPs often use Qualys under the hood.

- **Other Metrics**: Both companies maintain high customer renewal rates and have strong reputations. Qualys in 2021–2022 has been positioning itself in the emerging **CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)** category by combining its VM, container, cloud, and app security into one platform – a Gartner Market Guide for CNAPP (2022) included Qualys as a representative vendor ([Our Takeaways From 2024 Gartner Market Guide for Cloud-Native ...](https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2024/08/14/our-takeaways-from-2024-gartner-market-guide-for-cloud-native-application-protection-platforms-cnapp-insights-and-market-evolution#:~:text=Our%20Takeaways%20From%202024%20Gartner,of%20cloud%20%C2%B7%203)). Rapid7 is also moving toward a broader cloud-native security platform via InsightCloudSec plus workload coverage. 

- **Stock and Growth**: While not an analyst report, it’s worth noting market perception – Qualys is a public company (NASDAQ: QLYS) known for steady growth and profitability, often seen as a somewhat conservative but reliable player. Rapid7 (NASDAQ: RPD) has shown faster growth in recent years (due to expanding product lines like InsightIDR and services), though it has operated at a loss as it invests in growth. Investors see Qualys as a stable leader in VM and Rapid7 as an innovator in security operations; this also mirrors some customer attitudes (some choose Qualys for “tried-and-true” solutions, others choose Rapid7 for newer integrated approaches).

In summary, independent analyses confirm that **Qualys and Rapid7 are both top-tier vendors** in vulnerability management, each with their own strengths. Qualys often leads on vulnerability coverage and depth of scanning, while Rapid7 garners praise for its vision of a unified security platform and ease of use. Rapid7’s expansion into SIEM/XDR and services has earned it distinct accolades in those areas that Qualys doesn’t touch. For prospective customers, the analyst reports suggest that you won’t go wrong with either for core VM needs – it comes down to what adjacent capabilities or experience you value more. The market trend is towards integrated risk management and faster response, which plays to Rapid7’s portfolio strengths, whereas compliance-driven programs and large-scale asset management remain Qualys’s home turf. Both vendors have the confidence of a large portion of the cybersecurity community, reflected in awards, Waves/MQs, and customer choice recognitions over the past years.
